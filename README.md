##

**Purpose:**

ELIXIR-PT at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência, in cooperation with the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE Train-The-Trainer subtask, 
will hold a Train the Trainer (TtT) event for instructors and future instructors of the GTPB Programme. 

The course is made up of four sessions, covering: 

* [Learning principles and how they apply to training](./TtT_session_1.md)
* [Training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation] (./TtT_session_2.md)
* [Assessment and feedback in training] (./TtT_session_4.md)
* [Session, course, and materials design] (./TtT_session_3.md)


The learning objectives of the first day of the course (Thu, Jan 19th 2017) consist of exploring, discussing and understanding 
the themes of session 1 and 2.
On the second day (Fri, Jan 20th 2017) TtT participants will work on sessions 3 and 4 and will engage in two practical exercises:

* Running a training session based on an exercise (almost no lecture time).
* Running a flipped-classroom session, as instructors and as learners.

### Learning Objectives:  
 * To get acquainted with Learning principles and how they apply to training
 * To be able to select and utilise training techniques that can be used to enhance learner engagement and participation
 * To learn how to use assessment and feedback in training
 * To learn about session, course, and materials design

### Learning Outcomes:
 * Learners can tell which learning principles a good trainer should have in mind
 * Learners can describe at least three training techniques drawing on learning principles
 * Learners can design a training session and a course
 * Learners can develop assessment questionnaires
 * Learners can tell what types of material are needed for each part of a training session

## Materials to explore:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9orbxoRofI
* Random thoughts on How learning works, by Rebecca Brent and Richard M. Felder ([PDF](./docs/Ambrose_RandomThoughts_HowLearningWorks.pdf))
* Good teaching - the top ten requirements ([PDF](./docs/good_teaching_the_top_ten_requirements.pdf))

## Ideas for Challenges:

  * Design a diagnostic questionnaire;
  * Plan a session;
  * Design a course schedule;
  * Draw a concept map for a session;
  * Prepare a mini-presentation (3-mins); video yourself while delivering it; watch the video; adjust the mini-session and run it again [notice that you have to find a topic that can be taught in 3 minutes; it could be from any field]
  * Collect responses dynamically using Socrative or Learning Catalytics;
  * Create a group discussion and its annotation;
